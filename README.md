## Installations:
  1. You will need to install Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn.
  2. You will need to install the Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market).

## Project Motivation:
   I'm really intreasted in invstegating house pricing in Melbourne and how the factors such as Rooms, Bathroom & Region will affects the price.
  
## File Descriptions:
  1. Melbourne_housing_FULL.csv: This is the Dataset I used in my project .
  2. Write a Data Science Blog Post.ipynb: This is my notebook where I did my analysis.

## How To Interact With Your Project:
  - We found some interesting findings the price in Southern Metropolitan has the highest average price and demand and how Eastern Metropolitan has high average price and low demand.
  - Then I build a Linear Regression algorithm model using sklearn library to predict the houses price.
